# Tech Blog & Cheatsheets
I wanted something where I remember all the neat little code snippets I've created or find so I don't have to rewrite them in the future.

I will be rebuilding my website using the [`madrilene/eleventy-excellent`](https://github.com/madrilene/eleventy-excellent/) as a guiding template. Most likely forking it and modifying it. I will also be using [`rothsandro/eleventy-notes`](https://github.com/rothsandro/eleventy-notes)'s project as there is a lot of functionality therein that I want to use on my website.

## Features & Enhancements
- Website
  - Fix favicon
  - Pagination on the category pages
- Optional Features
  - Icon functionality set in `frontmatter`
  - Description for landing pages in frontmatter
- Description under the category name on the category page
  - https://tech.libresinn.com/cheatsheets/dotfiles/
  - Dotfiles
  - {{SOME DESCRIPTION}}
- Both blog & examples need to have a related section at the bottom
  - [Tags page](https://eleventy-notes.sandroroth.com/tags/)
  - [Callouts](https://eleventy-notes.sandroroth.com/n/writing/callouts/)
- Image management
  - Since I will also be using this website to house my blog I will want to handle images a little differently. To be researched.

## Directory reorganization
### Main
Once the [`feature/reorg`](https://github.com/mrpotatoes/cheatsheets/pull/3) pull request is merged I plan to further reorganize the folder structure. The root level structure will be thus
```

```

### Nested Cheatsheets
I am changing how the cheatsheets are loaded and whatever in this website. I want the ability to
