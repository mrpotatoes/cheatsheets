# Tech Blog & Cheatsheets
I wanted something where I remember all the neat little code snippets I've created or find so I don't have to rewrite them in the future.

I will be rebuilding my website using the [`madrilene/eleventy-excellent`](https://github.com/madrilene/eleventy-excellent/) as a guiding template. Most likely forking it and modifying it. I will also be using [`rothsandro/eleventy-notes`](https://github.com/rothsandro/eleventy-notes)'s project as there is a lot of functionality therein that I want to use on my website.
