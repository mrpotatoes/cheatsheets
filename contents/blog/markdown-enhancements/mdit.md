## About
I used the following plugins
- [`@mdit/plugin-tab`](https://mdit-plugins.github.io/tab.html)
- [`@mdit/plugin-sup`](https://mdit-plugins.github.io/sup.html)
- [`@mdit/plugin-sub`](https://mdit-plugins.github.io/sub.html)
- [`@mdit/plugin-align`](https://mdit-plugins.github.io/alight.html)
- [`@mdit/plugin-alert`](https://mdit-plugins.github.io/alert.html)
- [`@mdit/plugin-spoiler`](https://mdit-plugins.github.io/spoiler.html)
- [`@mdit/plugin-tasklist`](https://mdit-plugins.github.io/tasklist.html)
- [`@mdit/plugin-footnote`](https://mdit-plugins.github.io/footnote.html)

## Pros & Cons
**Pro**: What I like about the `@mdit/plugins-*` is that they are well maintained

**Con**: WHat I don't like is that the documentation doesn't come with example `.css` or `.js` that are needed for a bunch of these plugins and I had to do those myself.
