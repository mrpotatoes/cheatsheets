# `copypath`
Copies the current path you're on and adds it to your clipboard

When running the following
```sh
copypath
```

This is added to your your clipboard. Paste into your terminal and you'll automatically goto that directory. Great for opening multiple tabs in `iTerm`
```sh
cd "/Users/alibresinn/Projects/cheatsheets"; clear
```
