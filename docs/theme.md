# Theme

## Main Sections
There are 3 main sections to the website.

1. `Snippets` for copyable code snippets for quick access
1. `Projects` is a showcase. Think product pages + articles.
1. `Essasys` is my blog but I want it to be more of an experiance.

### Essays
I do not want a traditional blog section like every other website. I want my written sections to have more "drama" and to do that I want to use complex and alluring layouts and features. Essentially I want to be able to write `use case` or `design study` style pages. It'll be more heavy on the typeography so I wanted to make sure to focus on that.

I don't want to hand style each page as I want to focus mainly on the content and then pull in elements of a use case and put it into a markdown sheet.
