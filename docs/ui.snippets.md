# UI - Snippets
How I want the snippets UI to look

## Expectations
### Snippets Main Page
Snippets have an entry page that lists all the top-level categories. No snippets underneath. Shown as cards [preferably with snippets].

### On Fuzzy Search
- Fuzzy search is enabled on all category pages
- When on a category page only search the snippets & categories within that sub-tree
- The page itself, not the search, should do the filtering on the page

### Clicking Category
- Shows categories & snippets under that sub-tree
- When clicking a snippet 
  - Do I show it in a 3rd panel or under the page or new page?
  - Show all snippet content related
  - Show related & tagged
