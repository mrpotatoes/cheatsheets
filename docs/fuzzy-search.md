# Fuzzy Search Thoughts


## TODO
- [x] When searching hide the category navigation
  - [x] Toggle display
- [ ] Group links
  - [ ] Show in boxes
  - [ ] Group should have a link so that it'll load in `hotwire`
  - [ ] Decide on a data shape
- [ ] Find a client side js template library
- [ ] Pull in the JS and serve locally (within the build)
- [ ] Somehow compile the JS so it's
- [ ] I think I may need to work on my `head` stuff
  - [ ] Look to [`madrilene/eleventy-excellent`](https://github.com/madrilene/eleventy-excellent) for inspiration
- [ ] Too many typing errors, must fix
